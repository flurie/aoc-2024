# AOC 2024

A dummy repo set up to do Advent of Code in C++.

## Setup

This should work equally well in either macOS or Linux.

The following prerequisites must be installed:

- Nix
- devenv
- direnv (optional)

Everything else you need is installed using those.

## Architecture

| Tool  | choice  |
|-------|---------|
| LSP   | clangd  |
| build | Bazel 7 |
